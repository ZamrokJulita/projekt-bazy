# NATURAL MERGE SORT SIMULATION IN JAVA


Implemented a natural merge sort algorithm with simulated block-based disk I/O.
Enabled record generation, manual input, and test file loading, with phase-by-phase sorting visualization.
Tracked and displayed sorting phases and disk read/write operations for performance analysis.
